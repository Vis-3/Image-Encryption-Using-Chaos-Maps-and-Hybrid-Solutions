Project Description
This project investigates the use of chaotic maps and hybrid solutions for securing digital images.

Chaotic Maps:

Chaotic maps exhibit seemingly random and unpredictable behavior despite deterministic rules.
This project utilizes chaotic maps to scramble pixel values, rendering the image visually unrecognizable and resistant to attacks.
Hybrid Solutions:

Explores combining chaotic maps with the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for enhanced security.
Arnold cat map scrambles pixels followed by AES encryption for layered protection.
Key benefits:

High level of security against various attacks.
Good image quality preservation after decryption.
Comparison and Hybrid Approach:

Discusses advantages and disadvantages of both chaotic maps and AES.
Proposes a hybrid solution for increased security through multi-layered encryption.
Limitations:

Security depends on the strength of individual algorithms and encryption keys.
Implementation complexity may increase with hybrid solutions.
Note:

Jupyter notebook with code is unfortunately lost, but implementation details are available in the project report.
